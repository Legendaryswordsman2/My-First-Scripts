# Learning-to-code-in-C-Sharp

These are some of the very first scripts I ever created, back then I was mainly just copying from Brackeys tutorials and tweaking them a bit, but this is where I really got my start on learning how to program, this was also when I was first learning how to use Github and I didn't really know what I was doing so I made each script a new branch, so to check out all my different scripts just look at all the different branches
